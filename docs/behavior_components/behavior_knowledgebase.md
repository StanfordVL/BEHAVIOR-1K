# üç¥ **BEHAVIOR Knowledgebase**

## Overview

BEHAVIOR is short for Benchmark for Everyday Household Activities in Virtual, Interactive, and ecOlogical enviRonments.

[**BEHAVIOR Knowledgebase**](https://behavior.stanford.edu/knowledgebase/) contains information about what synsets are valid, their relationship between each other, their abilities (or properties), the hyperparameters of the abilities, and the hand-specified [transition rules](../modules/transition_rules.md).

Here are the important conceptual components of the BEHAVIOR Knowledgebase:


### [**Tasks**](https://behavior.stanford.edu/knowledgebase/tasks)
A family of 1000 long-horizon household activities.

- As illustrated in the [**BEHAVIOR Tasks tutorial**](behavior_tasks.md), each task definition contains a list of task-relevant objects, and their initial and goal conditions.
- The knowledgebase page also shows
    - Which scenes this task is compatible with.
    - (Experimental) The transition paths that help achieve the goal conditions.

### [**Synsets**](https://behavior.stanford.edu/knowledgebase/synsets)
The basic building block of the knowledgebase.

- We follow the [**WordNet**](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) hierarchy while expanding it with additional ("custom") synsets to suit the need of BEHAVIOR.
- Each synset has at least one parent synset, and can have many children synsets (no children means it's a leaf synset).
- Each synset can have many abilities (or properties).
    - Some properties define the physical attributes of the object and how OmniGibson simulates them, e.g. `liquid`, `cloth`, `visualSubstance`, etc.
    - Some properties define the semantic attributes (or affordances) of the object, e.g. `fillable`, `openable`, `cookable`, etc.
    - Each property might contain additional hyperparameters that define the exact behavior of the property, e.g. `heatSource` has hyperparameters `requires_toggled_on` (bool), `requires_closed` (bool), `requires_inside` (bool), `temperature` (float), and `heating_rate` (float).
- The knowledgebase page also shows
    - The predicates that are used for the synset in the task definitions.
    - The tasks that involve the synset.
    - The object categories and models that belong to the synset.
    - The transition rules that involve the synset.
    - The synset's position in the WordNet hierarchy (e.g. ancestors, descendants, etc).

### [**Categories**](https://behavior.stanford.edu/knowledgebase/categories)
The bridge between the WordNet(-like) synsets and OmniGibson's object and substance categories.

- Each category is mapped to **exactly one leaf synset**, e.g. `apple` is mapped to `apple.n.01`.
- Multiple categories can be mapped to the same synset, e.g. `drop_in_sink` and `pedestal_sink` both map to `sink.n.01`, and share the exact same properties (because properties are annotated at the synset level, not the category level).
- All objects belonging to the same category should share similar mass and size, i.e. should be interchangeable if object randomization is performed.
- The knowledgebase page also shows
    - The objects that belong to the category, as well as their images.
    - The corresponding synset's position in the WordNet hierarchy (e.g. ancestors, descendants, etc).

### [**Objects**](https://behavior.stanford.edu/knowledgebase/objects)
One-to-one mapping to a specific 3D object model in our dataset.

- Each object belongs to **exactly one category**, e.g. `coffee_maker-fwlabx` belongs to `coffee_maker`, correspounding to the object model residing at `<gm.DATASET_PATH>/objects/coffee_maker/fwlabx`.
- Each object can have multiple meta links that serve the relevant object states in OmniGibson. For example, for the [`coffee_maker-fwlabx`](https://behavior.stanford.edu/knowledgebase/objects/coffee_maker-fwlabx/index.html) object, it is annotated with `connectedpart` for the `AttachedTo` state, `heatsource` for the `HeatSourceOrSink` state, and `toggleButton` for the `ToggledOn` state.
- The knowledgebase page also shows
    - The object's image.
    - The scenes / rooms the object appears in.
    - The corresponding synset's position in the WordNet hierarchy (e.g. ancestors, descendants, etc).

### [**Scenes**](https://behavior.stanford.edu/knowledgebase/scenes)
One-to-one mapping to a specific 3D scene model in our dataset.

- Each scene consists of multiple rooms with the following naming convention: `<room_type>_<room_id>`, e.g. `living_room_0`, `kitchen_1`, etc.
- Each room contains a list of objects, e.g. in the [`Beechwood_0_int`](https://behavior.stanford.edu/knowledgebase/scenes/Beechwood_0_int/index.html) scene, `countertop-tpuwys: 6` means the `kitchen_0` room has 6 copies of the `countertop-tpuwys` object.

### [**Transition Rules**](https://behavior.stanford.edu/knowledgebase/transitions/index.html)
Hand-specified rules that define complex physical or chemical interactions between objects and substances that are not natively supported by Omniverse.

- Each transition rule specifies a list of input synsets and a list of output synsets, as well as the conditions that need to be satisfied for the transition to occur.
- For instance, in the [`beef_stew`](https://behavior.stanford.edu/knowledgebase/transitions/beef_stew) rule, the input synsets are `ground_beef.n.01`, `beef_broth.n.01`, `pea.n.01`, `diced__carrot.n.01` and `diced__vidalia_onion.n.01` and the output synset is `beef_stew.n.01`.
- The conditions are not yet visualized on the website, but you can manually inspect them in the [JSON files](https://github.com/StanfordVL/bddl/tree/master/bddl/generated_data/transition_map/tm_jsons).

We have 6 different types of transition rules:

- `WasherRule`: remove "dirty" substance from the washer if the necessary solvent is present, and wet the objects inside by making them either `Saturated` with or `Covered` by `water`.
- `DryerRule`: dry the objects inside by making them not `Saturated` with `water`, and remove all `water` from the dryer.
- `SlicingRule`: when an object with the `slicer` ability exerts a sufficient force on another object with the `sliceable` ability, it slices the latter object into two halves.
- `DicingRule`: when an object with the `slicer` ability exerts a sufficient force on another object with the `diceable` ability, it dices the latter object into the corresounding diced substance.
- `MeltingRule`: when an object with the `meltable` ability reaches a certain temperature, it melts into the corresounding melted substance.
- `RecipeRule`: a general framework of recipe-based transitions that involve multiple objects and substances, and custom defined conditions.
    - `input_objects`: input objects and their counts that are required
    - `input_systems`: input systems that are required
    - `output_objects`: output objects and their counts that are produced
    - `output_systems`: output systems that are produced (the quantity depends on the collective volume of the input objects and systems)
    - `input_states`: the states that the input objects and systems should satisfy, e.g. an ingredient should not be `cooked` already.
    - `output_states`: the states that the output objects and systems should satisfy, e.g. the dish should be `cooked` after the recipe is done.
    - `fillable_categories`: `fillable` object categories needed for the recipe, e.g. pots and pans for cooking, and coffee makers for brewing coffee.

We have 5 different types of `RecipeRule`s:

- `CookingPhysicalParticleRule`: "cook" physical particles. It might or might not require water, depending on the synset's property `waterCook`.
    - Requires water: `rice` + `cooked__water` -> `cooked__rice`.
    - Doesn't require water: `diced__chicken` -> `cooked__diced__chicken`.
- `ToggleableMachineRule`: leverages a `toggleable` ability machine (e.g. electric mixer, coffee machine, blender) that needs to be `ToggledOn`.
    - Output is a single object: `flour` + `butter` + `sugar` -> `dough`; the machine is `electric_mixer`.
    - Output is a single system: `strawberry` + `milk` -> `strawberry_smoothie`; the machine is `blender`.
- `MixingToolRule`: leverages a `mixingTool` ability object that gets into contact with a `fillable` ability object.
    - Output is a single system: `water` + `lemon_juice` + `sugar` -> `lemonade`; the mixing tool is `spoon`.
- `CookingRule`: leverages a `heatsource` ability object and a `fillable` ability object for general cooking.
    - `CookingObjectRule`: Output is one or more objects: `bagel_dough` + `egg` + `sesame_seed` -> `bagel`; the heat source is `oven`; the container is `baking_sheet`.
    - `CookingSystemRule`: Output is a single system: `beef` + `tomato` + `chicken_stock` -> `stew`; the heat source is `stove`; the container is `stockpot`.


## Usage

OmniGibson interfaces with the BEHAVIOR Knowledgebase via a single interface: the [`ObjectTaxonomy`](https://github.com/StanfordVL/bddl/blob/master/bddl/object_taxonomy.py) class.

Here is an example of how to use the `ObjectTaxonomy` class to query the BEHAVIOR Knowledgebase.

```{.python .annotate}
from omnigibson.utils.bddl_utils import OBJECT_TAXONOMY

# Get parents / children / ancestors / descendants / leaf descendants of a synset
parents = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.get_parents("fruit.n.01")
children = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.get_children("fruit.n.01")
ancestors = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.get_ancestors("fruit.n.01")
descendants = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.get_descendants("fruit.n.01")
leaf_descendants = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.get_leaf_descendants("fruit.n.01")

# Checker functions for synsets
is_leaf = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.is_leaf("fruit.n.01")
is_ancestor = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.is_ancestor("fruit.n.01", "apple.n.01")
is_descendant = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.is_descendant("apple.n.01", "fruit.n.01")
is_valid = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.is_valid_synset("fruit.n.01")

# Get the abilities of a synset, e.g. "coffee_maker.n.01" -> {'rigidBody': {...}, 'heatSource': {...}, 'toggleable': {...}, ...}
abilities = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.get_abilities("coffee_maker.n.01")

# Check if a synset has a specific ability, e.g. "coffee_maker.n.01" has "heatSource"
has_ability = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.has_ability("coffee_maker.n.01", "heatSource")

# Get the synset of a object category, e.g. "apple" -> "apple.n.01"
object_synset = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.get_synset_from_category("apple")

# Get the object categories of a synset, e.g. "apple.n.01" -> ["apple"]
object_categories = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.get_categories("apple.n.01")

# Get the object categories of all the leaf descendants of a synset, e.g. "fruit.n.01" -> ["apple", "banana", "orange", ...]
leaf_descendant_categories = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.get_subtree_categories("fruit.n.01")

# Get the synset of a substance category , e.g. "water" -> "water.n.06"
substance_synset = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.get_synset_from_substance("water")

# Get the substance categories of a synset, e.g. "water.n.06" -> ["water"]
substance_categories = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.get_substances("water.n.06")

# Get the substance categories of all the leaf descendants of a synset, e.g. "liquid.n.01" -> ["water", "milk", "juice", ...]
leaf_descendant_substances = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.get_subtree_substances("liquid.n.01")
```

## (Advanced) Customize BEHAVIOR Knowledgebase

To customize BEHAVIOR Knowedgebase, you can modify the source CSV files in the [bddl](https://github.com/StanfordVL/bddl/tree/master/bddl/generated_data) repository, and then rebuild the knowledgebase.

### Rebuild Knowledgebase

To rebuild the knowledgebase, you need to run the following command:

```bash
cd bddl
python data_generation/generate_datafiles.py
```

To make sure the new knowledgebase is consistent with the task definitions, you should also run the following command:

```bash
python tests/bddl_tests.py batch_verify
python tests/tm_tests.py
```

If you encounter any errors during the rebuilding process, please read the error messages carefully and try to fix the issues accordingly.
