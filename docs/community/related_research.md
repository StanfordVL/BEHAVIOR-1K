### ü¶æ [BEHAVIOR Robot Suite](https://behavior-robot-suite.github.io/)

BEHAVIOR Robot Suite (BRS) is a comprehensive framework for whole-body manipulation in household tasks, addressing key robotics challenges including bimanual coordination, stable navigation, and extensive reachability. Built on a bimanual wheeled robot with a 4-DoF torso, BRS integrates a cost-effective teleoperation interface for data collection and a novel algorithm for learning whole-body visuomotor policies.

### üõãÔ∏è [Automated Creation of Digital Cousins for Robust Policy Learning](https://digital-cousins.github.io/)

ACDC (Automatic Creation of Digital Cousins) is a method that addresses the limitations of real-world robot training and simulation-to-real transfer by introducing "digital cousins" - virtual environments that capture similar geometric and semantic affordances to real scenes without explicitly modeling them.

### üëì [BEHAVIOR Vision Suite](https://behavior-vision-suite.github.io/)

BEHAVIOR Vision Suite is a synthetic data generator that addresses limitations in current computer vision datasets by providing high-quality, controllable data generation. It offers adjustable parameters at scene, object, and camera levels, enabling researchers to conduct controlled experiments.

## Previous BEHAVIOR Versions

### üõèÔ∏è [BEHAVIOR-100](https://behavior.stanford.edu/behavior-100)

BEHAVIOR-100 is the first generation of BEHAVIOR, a benchmark for embodied AI with 100 activities in simulation, spanning a range of everyday household chores such as cleaning, maintenance, and food preparation.

## Gibson Series

### üè†[Gibson](http://gibsonenv.stanford.edu/)

Gibson Environment is a virtual environment designed to address the challenges of developing real-world perception for active agents, where physical training is slow, costly, and impractical. Built on virtualized real spaces rather than artificial designs, Gibson includes over 1400 floor spaces from 572 buildings.

### üè° [iGibson 1.0](https://svl.stanford.edu/igibson/)

iGibson 1.0 is a simulation environment for developing robotic solutions for interactive tasks in realistic large-scale scenes. It features 15 fully interactive home-sized scenes with 108 rooms containing rigid and articulated objects that replicate real-world homes.

### üèòÔ∏è [iGibson 2.0](https://svl.stanford.edu/igibson/)

iGibson 2.0 is an open-source simulation environment that expands beyond motion and physical contact to support diverse household tasks through three key innovations. It simulates object states, implements predicate logic functions, and includes a VR interface for collecting human demonstrations.
