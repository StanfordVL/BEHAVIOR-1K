# **Important Concepts**

In this document, we discuss and disambiguate a number of concepts that are central to working with OmniGibson and BEHAVIOR-1K.

---

## :material-brain: **BEHAVIOR Concepts**

At a high level, the BEHAVIOR dataset consists of **tasks**, **synsets**, **categories**, **objects**, and **substances**. These are all interconnected and are used to define and simulate household robotics.

### Core Concepts

=== ":material-format-list-checks: Tasks"

    !!! info "What are Tasks?"
        Tasks in BEHAVIOR are **first-order logic formalizations** of 1000+ long-horizon household activities that survey participants indicated they would benefit from robot help with.

    **Key Components:**
    
    - **Object Scope**: List of objects needed for the task
    - **Initial Conditions**: What a scene should look like when the task begins
    - **Goal Conditions**: What needs to be true for the task to be considered completed
    
    !!! example "Task Definition Process"
        - Task definitions are **symbolic** - they can be grounded in a particular scene with particular objects
        - This creates a **task instance** through a process called **sampling**
        - Sampling finds scenes and rooms that match requirements and configures objects to satisfy initial conditions

=== ":material-graph: Synsets"

    !!! info "What are Synsets?"
        Synsets are the **nouns** used in BDDL object scopes, expanded from the WordNet hierarchy with additional synsets to suit BEHAVIOR needs.

    **Structure:**
    
    - Organized as a **directed acyclic graph** 
    - Each synset can have parents/ancestors and children/descendants
    - High flexibility: when a task requires `grocery.n.01`, it can use any descendant like `apple.n.01`
    
    !!! tip "Synset Annotations"
        Each synset is annotated with **abilities and parameters** that define expected behaviors:
        
        - 🚰 Faucet → source of water
        - 🚪 Door → openable
        - 🔥 Stove → heat source

=== ":material-tag: Categories"

    !!! info "What are Categories?"
        Categories act as a **bridge** between synsets and OmniGibson's objects. Each category maps to one leaf synset and can contain multiple objects.

    **Purpose: Disambiguation**
    
    Both wall-mounted and standing sinks are semantically `sink.n.01` (same functions), but they shouldn't be swapped during randomization for physical/visual realism.
    
    !!! example "Category Example"
        ```
        Synset: sink.n.01
        ├── Category: wall_mounted_sink
        └── Category: standing_sink
        ```

=== ":material-cube: Objects"

    !!! info "What are Objects?"
        Objects denote **specific 3D object models** in the dataset. Each object belongs to one category and has a unique 6-character ID.

    **Features:**
    
    - **Articulations**: Movable parts and joints
    - **Metadata**: Annotations for synset abilities
    - **Physics Properties**: Materials, collision, etc.
    
    !!! example "Object Annotation"
        A faucet object needs annotation for **water output position** because its synset defines it as a fluid source.

=== ":material-home: Scenes"

    !!! info "What are Scenes?"
        Scenes are **specific configurations of objects** that form complete environments.

    **BEHAVIOR-1K Ships With:**
    
    - 🏠 **50 base scenes** showing variety of environments
    - 🏢 Houses, offices, restaurants, etc.
    - 🎲 **Object randomization** capability
    - 📋 **Task instances** with pre-configured setups
    
    !!! tip "Scene Flexibility"
        Objects can be replaced with others from the same category within existing bounding boxes during randomization.

=== ":material-water: Substances & Systems"

    !!! info "What are Substances?"
        Some synsets (like water) are marked as **substances** and implemented as **particle systems** in OmniGibson.

    **Types of Particle Systems:**
    
    | Type | Behavior | Rendering |
    |------|----------|-----------|
    | 💧 Fluids | Water-like physics | Fluid rendering |
    | 🎨 Stains | Visual particles | Custom meshes |
    | 🌫️ Smoke | Atmospheric effects | Volumetric rendering |
    
    !!! note "Singleton Implementation"
        There's only **one** particle system per substance type per scene (e.g., one water system), but particles can be placed arbitrarily.

=== ":material-arrow-decision: Transition Rules"

    !!! info "What are Transition Rules?"
        Transition rules define **complex physical or chemical interactions** between objects and substances not natively supported by Omniverse.

    **Rule Types:**
    
    - 🧼 **Washing**: Cleaning objects
    - 🌬️ **Drying**: Removing moisture
    - 🔪 **Slicing/Dicing**: Cutting objects
    - 🔥 **Melting**: State changes
    - 👨‍🍳 **Recipe-based**: Cooking transformations
    
    !!! example "Rule Application"
        When input requirements are satisfied → remove some objects/substances → add new ones to the scene
